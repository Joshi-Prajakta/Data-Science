We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.\\n\\nROYCE: You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.\\n\\nWILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.\\n\\nROYCE: It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again.\\n\\nROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.\\n\\nWILL: They were here.\\n\\nGARED: See where they went.\\n\\nROYCE: What is it?\\n\\nJON: Go on. Father’s watching.\\n\\nJON: And your mother.\\n\\nSEPTA MORDANE: Fine work, as always. Well done.\\n\\nSANSA: Thank you.\\n\\nSEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners.\\n\\nNED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.\\n\\nJON: Don’t think too much, Bran.\\n\\nROBB: Relax your bow arm.\\n\\nCASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.\\n\\nNED: Get the lads to saddle their horses.\\n\\nCATELYN: Do you have to?\\n\\nNED: He swore an oath, Cat.\\n\\nCASSEL: The law is law, my lady.\\n\\nNED: Tell Bran he’s coming, too.\\n\\nCATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.\\n\\nNED: He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.\\n\\nROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest.\\n\\nNED: King of the Andals and the First Men …\\n\\nJON: Father will know if you do.\\n\\nNED: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.\\n\\nJON: You did well.\\n\\nNED: You understand why I did it?\\n\\nBRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.\\n\\nNED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?\\n\\nBRAN: Our way is the old way?\\n\\nNED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.\\n\\nBRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?\\n\\nNED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.\\n\\nBRAN: So he was lying?\\n\\nNED: A madman sees what he sees.\\n\\nJON: What is it?\\n\\nTHEON: Mountain lion?\\n\\nNED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.\\n\\nTHEON: It’s a freak.\\n\\nNED: It’s a direwolf.\\n\\nNED: Tough old beast.\\n\\nROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.\\n\\nJON: Now there are five.\\n\\nJON: You want to hold it?\\n\\nBRAN: Where will they go?

There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.\\n\\nNED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.\\n\\nBRAN: What about you?\\n\\nJON: I’m not a Stark. Get on.\\n\\nROBB: What is it?\\n\\nCERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?\\n\\nJAIME: But who would he tell?\\n\\nCERSEI: My husband.\\n\\nJAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.\\n\\nCERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.\\n\\nJAIME: That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.\\n\\nCATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.\\n\\nNED: You have five northern children.

No more climbing.\\n\\nNED: Your Grace.\\n\\nROBERT: You’ve got fat.\\n\\nROBERT: Cat!\\n\\nCATELYN: Your Grace.\\n\\nROBERT: Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?\\n\\nNED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.\\n\\nARYA: Where’s the Imp?\\n\\nSANSA: Will you shut up?\\n\\nROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb.\\n\\nARYA: Arya.\\n\\nROBERT: Ooh. Show us your muscles. You’ll be a soldier.\\n\\nARYA: That’s Jaime Lannister.

Go find the little beast.\\n\\nNED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.\\n\\nROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.\\n\\nNED: We both did.\\n\\nROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.\\n\\nNED: Aye.\\n\\n'"
